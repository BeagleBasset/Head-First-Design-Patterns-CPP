# Head-First-Design-Patterns-CPP

This repository contains a selection of examples from the [Head First Design Patterns, 2nd Edition](https://wickedlysmart.com/head-first-design-patterns/) book, rewritten in C++. The code is primarily for my own learning and deepening of my knowledge of design patterns, and is not intended to serve as a complete conversion of the Java source code in the book (which can be found on the official website). I have made an effort to leverage modern C++ features, such as using smart pointers instead of traditional raw pointers. The source files were created using the VSCode editor.

## Repository Structure

This repository follows the structure of the **Head First Design Patterns** book. The examples are organized to mirror the chapters and patterns presented in the book, making it easy to navigate through the different design patterns covered. Each folder typically corresponds to a chapter from the book, and inside youâ€™ll find the C++ implementation of the respective design pattern.

## Usage

To get started with the examples in this repository, you can clone it using the following command:

      git clone https://github.com/BeagleBasset/Head-First-Design-Patterns-CPP.git

Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the individual files in a C++ IDE or editor such as VSCode or CLion, and start exploring the code.

## Compilation

If you want to compile and run the examples locally, you can use the following steps:
  1. Navigate to the folder containing the example you wish to compile.
  2. If you have the **g++** compiler installed, use the following command to compile the code:

          g++ -std=c++17 -o main *.cpp
    
  3. After compilation, run the program using:

          ./main

This will compile and execute the C++ examples.
You can also use other C++ compilers. Just **ensure they support the C++17 standard** and modify the command accordingly to fit your compiler.
